Azure Data Factory is used for ingesting data stored in the web and on-premise to Data Lake gen 2 using automated pipelines. Azure Data Lake Gen 2 is used for storage of data. Databricks could be connected to Data Lake Gen 2 where the raw data is stored in the container. Databricks is used for data transformation as it provides the power of Apache spark without the requirement for setting up the environment. Then the data tranformed is stored back to Data Lake gen 2. Azure Synapse Analytics helps in setting up a database and querying it.
